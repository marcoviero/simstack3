Welcome to the public site for [Viero et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14312).  To get started, you first need to have installed and setup [simstack3](https://github.com/marcoviero/simstack3).
See this [README](https://github.com/marcoviero/simstack3/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on how to do that.  

Next, you need data.  See this [notebook](https://github.com/marcoviero/simstack3/blob/main/viero2022/notebooks/V0_data_acquisition.ipynb) for instructions on downloading it. 

Finally, contained in this directory are a configuration file and Jupyter notebooks with instructions to exactly reproduce the V22 results. 

We encourage you to play with it!  Try your own binning!  Split the catalog up into more populations (AGN?!).  Get in touch if you have questions or problems.
